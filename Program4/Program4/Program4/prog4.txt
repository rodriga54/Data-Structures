\f1 This is a book about the computer language called C. If you are\
seeking a book to increase your typing speed, expand on your\
knowledge of word processing, or learn the secrets of chip\
fabrication and design, this is not the one for you. However , if\
you want to become thoroughly familiar with the C programming\
language, then you have made a wise choice. For this book is devoted\
to just that--to help you become proficient in C.\
\
        It is one thing to read about a language; it is quite another to\
get involved in it.. The best and most time-effective way to absorb\
a language such as C is to have 1 terminal or computer available to\
you , preferably at you fingertips. You will be exposed  to well\
over 100 C programs in this book.\
\
        You are encouraged to experiment with the programs illustrated\
in this text. Omit keywords, change a comma to a period, ,\
deliberately forget to terminate a statement with the required\
semicolon, etc. You can do whatever you want without having to worry\
about causing any damage to the computer, because you simply can't.\
Play "what if" games to your heart's content. Familiarity with the\
language will bring with it greater understanding ;the more you\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri720
\cf0 understand about "C", the more you will enjoy it. ???
